Error handling has not been implemented in this API

Any parameter value is allowed - This is a bug

Any name for a parameter 'id' is allowed. for e.g. id1, id57, idrt - This is a bug

For the multiple ids, there should be a single parameter such as ids=2,3,4 but currently it accepts as id=2&id=3&id=4
https://api.restful-api.dev/objects?id=1&id=2&id=3

it should be:
https://api.restful-api.dev/objects?ids=2,3,4

Currently, patch or put methods are not allowed in this API and are throwing errors.
